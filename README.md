# Development Notes
- Changed to Typescript
- Used Styled Components
  - Rules of use it:
    - More than 2 styleds in one file === Folder and .styled.tsx file (It's better to have this, if not it's so verbose, t he perfect example is Card)
    - Why there's some styleds totally empty? Better reading in html(website) in development and production.
    - used macro because Create React app is not compatible with babelrc (but I keep the config anyway)
- SVGs  
  - All the types of use are in porpuse.
    - I prefer to have inlines for icons for exception.
- Used an API to gather random images.
- Containers have all the main information about the game
    - Maybe a second iteration of the test may put all the CardContainer stuff(Logic) inside a hook to just have a few lines but actually I don't know if it benefits this app because it's so small.
- Testing
 - Components are not tested they we're going to be tested with Storybook but I didn't added because I wasn't have time.
    - If you have storybook to test components (dummy or not), you can test better than just a false rendering in jest.
 - Functions with random returns are not tested to be a pain to test them
 - Contexts are pretty nasty to test, May I want to test the reducers but I need to export it unnecessarily to the context of the aplication.
